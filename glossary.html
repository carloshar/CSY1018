              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">ASCII</a>  American Standard Code for Information Interchange. A code that represents English characters as numbers, ranging from 0 to 127. Commonly used by computers and browsers, ASCII codes make it possible to transfer data from one computer to another computer (like a server). In terms of transferring data from a computer to a server (called "uploading"), you would need to use either ASCII or Binary, depending on the type of file being transferred.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">BANDWIDTH</a>  It may help if you read "traffic" first, but very simply, bandwidth relates to how much a resource is used. An analogy would be a freeway. The wider the freeway, the more traffic (users) it can handle. The narrower it is, the less people can use it at once (without problems).
              When a website gets a lot of visitors, it will use a lot of bandwidth
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">BINARY</a>  A numbering system that consists of only two numbers, 0 and 1. Everything that you type or input into a computer is converted into binary – a unique combination of the zeros and ones. Screens and printers then convert this binary code back into what you inputted. When uploading (transferring) information (files) from a computer to a server, certain files need to be transferred as binary in order to be correctly interpreted and rendered. The alternative to binary for uploading is ASCII.

            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">BLOG</a>  An online journal or diary and a very popular current method of sharing your thoughts with the world. It is also very popular as a marketing tool.

            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">BOUNCE</a>  When you send an email to someone and it comes straight back to you with an error message, it is said to have bounced. It’s like the internet version of "return to sender" except it is a computer or piece of software automatically sending it back to you, not a person. Emails can bounce for many reasons. The most common are: you made a spelling or typing error in the address, making the address invalid; the person you are sending to no longer has that email address; the person you are sending to has let their mailbox become too full to accept new emails; a piece of software on the receiving end thinks that your email is spam or that it includes a virus and sends it back to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">BROADBAND</a>  Relates to a type of internet connection. When someone says they have a broadband connection it means they are connecting using a service that provides greater speed. ADSL is one example of a broadband connection. It also often means greater reliability because you will not experience as many time-outs and also because more people can use a broadband connection at the same time without it causing "traffic congestion" (which slows everything up – just as it does when you are driving on a busy road).
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">BROWSER</a>  When you visit a website, you are seeing it on a browser. Websites look very different in reality to what you see when you visit it. Everything is in fact encoded. A browser is the piece of software that decodes everything so that what you see is an attractive page rather than a lot of coding. Most people use the Microsoft Internet Explorer browser, which comes with all Windows software. If you look at the top right of your screen right now, just under the "X" you will see a little picture. This picture tells you what browser you are using. If the picture is a wavy square with smaller squares in red, green, blue and yellow, you are using IE (Internet Explorer). If it is something different, then you probably know all this already.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">CACHE</a> Every time you do anything on your computer, it stores this in memory so that the next time you try to do the same thing, it happens quicker than having to wait from scratch. The place where it stores all this is called the "cache". The irony is that if your cache gets too full, it in fact makes your computer work a lot slower. It’s a good idea to empty your cache regularly to keep your computer working optimally.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">CC</a> Means "Carbon Copy". An email feature. Use this to send a copy of an email to one or many other people at the same time that you are sending it to the main recipient/s.

            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">CHAT</a>  In the context of the internet "chat" is a feature that allows users from all over the globe to communicate in real time or almost real time. Conventional chat is communication via typing which then appears on the recipient’s screen. This is done via a piece of software that exists on a server. In some cases you need to install complimentary software onto your own computer as well. Complete chat communities exist that allow people to join in on general conversations with many other users at the same time or with a single person at a time. These "meeting places" are referred to as "chat rooms". One on one chat can also take place privately by using a piece of software on your computer called a messenger. This has to be especially downloaded and installed from a website that uses this technology. Some of the more common, advanced chat facilities are provided by yahoo, msn and icq.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">CODE</a> Nothing that you see on the internet is what it appears to be. Everything is coded in one way or another to achieve the exact look, layout and functions. There are different types of code and coding languages that are used to develop websites as well as all computer programmes and software.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">DATABASE DRIVEN</a>  With a normal static website, the information that you see is on the page itself. It does not change unless someone manually edits the page. On a database driven website, the information is not stored on the page, but in a database. Every time someone visits a particular page, the information is drawn from the database in order to display it on the page. Information can therefore be easily cross-referenced and the same information applied in many different ways, using formulas and different variables.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">DOWNLOAD</a> When you transfer information from a website or server to your computer, this is called downloading. Collecting email is therefore a download, as is saving a document from the internet to your computer or installing a software programme directly from the internet. Every time that you visit a website you are also downloading, because the information is passing from the server to your computer and often saved there without you even knowing (see "cookies"). This becomes quite important if you are using something like ADSL to connect to the internet, where you have a limit on bandwidth because you use bandwidth every time you download anything. The bigger the download, the greater the bandwidth that you are using.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">DNS</a> Stands for Domain Name Service (alternately Domain Name System or Domain Name Server). Basically, it’s the thing that converts IP addresses into domain names. DNS servers are provided with the IP address of your web server when you assign your domain name to those servers. In turn, when someone types your domain name into their web browser, those DNS servers translate the domain name to the IP address and point the browser to the correct web server

            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">DOCTYPE</a> The doctype declaration specifies which version of HTML is used in a document. It has a direct effect on whether your HTML will validate.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">DOMAIN NAME EXTENSION</a> Often referred to as Internet top-level domains (TLDs). The official list of all top level domains is maintained by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). Each country is designated an extension; Australia is .au, India is .in, United States of America is .us and not .com as most people think. The .com extension actually refers to commercial and is open for any entity or person to register, so a .com.au means a commercial extension in Australia. Some extensions are limited to certain groups such as .edu for educational institutions and .gov for governments.

            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">ELEMENT</a> A HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag.

            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">EMAIL</a>  The internet equivalent to post and mail, email is an encoded message that is sent instantly to someone else’s computer. It is however a "best attempt" facility and not foolproof, largely because of the complexity of the internet itself and the vast number of things that can cause the process to stall or fail.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">FONT FAMILY</a>  Font family is a group designation for defining the typefaces used in CSS documents.

            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">HEXADECIMAL</a>  Also referred to a “hex” numbers, they are a base-16 numbering system used to define colours online. Hex numbers include the numerals 0-9 and letters A-F. Hexadecimal numbers are written in three sets of hex pairs. Because screen colours are RGB (Red, Green, Blue), the first pair defines the red hue, the second pair defines the green hue, and the third pair defines the blue.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">HTTP</a> HyperText Transfer Protocol. This is a method used to transfer information on the internet and normally precedes the "description" of the actual resource being accessed and transferred. For example, web sites and web pages are one type of resource, identified by their domain name (www.domain.com.au)
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">HTTPS</a>  Similar to HTTP, HTTPS stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol over SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or, alternately, HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. Like HTTP, it”s a set of rules for transferring hypertext requests between browsers and servers, but this time it”s done over a secure, encrypted connection.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">JAVASCRIPT</a>  Coding languages used to achieve effects and functions on websites that normal html and its variants cannot achieve. These bits of coding (or scripts) are normally embedded into a web page and will automatically activate as soon as someone arrives on the page. Please note that JavaScript is distinctly different to Java.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">LANDING PAGE</a> A landing page is the page where a visitor first enters a website. Oftentimes, a special landing page is created to elicit a specific action from the new visitor (usually in connection with an advertising or marketing campaign).
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">OPTIMISE</a> Has two possible meanings in web design. The first is website/page optimisation. This relates to how the page is structured (both code and content) with regard to search engines. A well optimised website is search engine friendly. The second meaning relates to graphics and pictures that are used on websites. An optimised graphic is one that has been compressed as far as possible without sacrificing acceptable quality. This allows the image to load more quickly when someone visits a website.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">PHP</a> A programming language that is Linux based rather than Windows based.

There is a second meaning as well, more commonly used with regard to marketing and SEO and related specifically to Google. Each page of a website is given a ranking by Google, from 1-10. This ranking is the value that Google places on that particular page in relation to its subject matter and how relevant it is. The more relevant a page is believed to be the higher its ranking.
            </p>
            <p>
              <a href="http://www.thinkingit.com.au/glossary-of-website-terminology/">ROOT</a> In the context used here, this relates to website hosting. Often when you want to install a piece of software to work on (or run) your site, you will need "root access". This means that you have access to your hosting space at the highest level. To explain further: the information on the server is stored in different folders, arranged in a hierarchical order. The main folder in which all the other folders and sub-folders for your account are kept, is the root folder. If you go into your account on the server and can only see the main content folders, then you do not have root access.
