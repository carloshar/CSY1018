            <p>My chosen computing path is Bsc Computing I chose computing as it was a general topic and would allow me to choose the topic I enjoyed most at the end of my first year insted of commiting myself to a topic from year 1. I have only been studying computers/computing for 2 years now as it was not avaliable as a GCSE for me but I was hooked from my first lesson.  </p>

              I feel my generation is probably the most ignorant of all generations thus far. We since babys have had access to technology that was only mentioned in sci-fi, yet for 16 years of my life I just took it for granted. Then I took computer science as one of my A-Levels and from just a 1 hour lesson my understanding of my life had been widened dramatically. Previous to this i loved physics learning how the world worked and there was allways something new to learn until A-Levels you realise physics is waiting for answers but computer science is creating them. My goal is to learn something new everyday and i think computer science can take me there.
